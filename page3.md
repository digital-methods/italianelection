## REACTIONS

# Hahas

The "hahas" were particularly interesting - the highest positive correlations were the topics mentioning the politician of the page, the lowest the other two. This suggests there were a number of mocking posts on the pages, or that critics reacted to supporters' posts often.

# Angrys

The only significant correlations were between the polticians and either themselves or their parties. The negative correlation between Salvini and Renzi was also significant.

Only two boxes were significant: Salvini with immigration, which was positively correlated, and Salvini with economy, which was negatively correlated. This fits in with his platform.

# Sads

The sad reactions were particularly interesting. The highest correlation was between Salvini and Renzi/PD, which could be a result of many factors. Perhaps there were a number of pro- or anti-Renzi comments on Salvini's page that gathered a strong response, or perhaps the comments on Salvini's page were particularly incline towards talking about Renzi's government. It is also possible that many of Salvini's posts were critical of Renzi. Interestingly, only Renzi is positively correlated with sad reactions on Salvini's page, which would fit with this hypothesis.

It is worth nothing that the other two politicians are negatively correlated with the Renzi topic. The opposite is true for Di Maio - he is moderately positively correlated with the topic about him and his party. This also implies that there were perhaps critical comments on his page, or that his posts indicated that he was feeling attacked.

The last interesting remark about this is the fact that for the topic of taxes, the correlation with Di Maio's is high: this probably shows the concerns of his supporters towards the topic of taxation.
