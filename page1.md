# Methodology & Research Design

In our study on the Italian elections, we decided to turn to the electorate, in order to understand answer a crucial question: what were Italian voters talking about in the run up to the national ballot? We thought it would be interesting not to focus on the speeches or the interviews of the candidate, considering the themes that each party brought forward are easily identifiable through a quick look at their program, and therefore a digital analysis might have brought little added value. Instead, by focusing on what the voters were saying, we wanted to look at whether and how citizens pick up the rhetoric of politicians, and which topics they considered most important and valuable to be discussed on a social media platform like Facebook. Therefore, we proceeded with the selection of our sample.

In terms of time, we chose to focus on the one month before the date of the election, so from February 2nd, 2018 to March 4th 2018. This choice is justified by the fact that under Italian law, this is the official period of campagna elettorale (electoral campaigning). However, we still needed to decide which comment section(s) we wanted to analyze. In the beginning we considered to take into consideration the comment section of the Facebook pages of the biggest Italian newspapers. This turned out to be rather impractical for a number of reasons. First, the news are not only about domestic politics. More and more newspapers share topics related to much more trivial news that would have represented a great amount of noise in our sample. Second, and more importantly, with the breakout of the “Cambridge Analytica” scandal, Facebook proceeded to change his API policy, making scraping a large amount of posts impossible for us.

## Research question

Hence, we opted instead to look at the comments of the personalities which led (formally or informally) the current three biggest parties in the Italian Parliament: **Matteo Renzi, Luigi di Maio, and Matteo Salvini**. Considering that politicians post in a smaller amount than newspapers, the scraping turned out to me easier and the interest for the analysis remained. By looking at what supporters or detractors were talking about under their Facebook statuses or shared links, we thought we could get an idea about

1. **what issues were brought up the most by them, and in particular** 

2. **whether they reflected the themes offered by the platforms of the politicians**. 

3. Sentiment analysis + Contentingency matrix-related RQ

## Hypothesis 

Finally, we formulated the hypothesis we wanted to test through our study, that is the following: 

> **“The comments to the posts of political leaders mirror the themes and the rhetoric present by each of their political platforms".**

When looking at the specific cases, this hypothesis eventually turns into **three different hypotheses** to test for each candidate. By looking at the different party programs, we expected the following. 

1. With regards to Renzi (Partito Democratico), we expected to see a discourse revolving around the _economic activity_ and _jobs_ with a special focus on _schooling_, _lower taxes_ and some hints of more _European cooperation_. 
2. As for Di Maio (Movimento 5 Stelle), we expected discussions on what seemed to be most important – and controversial – point of his party’s campaign, that of the _basic universal income_. Since that, together with _lower taxes_, this was one of the few prominent topics we could identify, we were interested in exploring what 5 Stars voters also discussed about. 
3. Finally, for Salvini (Lega Nord) our main hypothesis was related to a strong focus on _anti-immigration rhetoric_, which is one of the major stances of the right-wing candidate. In addition, his platform promoted _anti-European stances_, proposals for _lower taxes_ and _pension reforms_: all topics we predicted that would lead the public discourse of his party’s voters.
